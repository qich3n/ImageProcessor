The program supports the following features of loading an image, and
saving an image. Along with these features, it supports the features
of Color Transformation, Brighten, Blur, Sharpen, Vertical Flip and Horizontal Flip.
Overall, the code was updated so that it supports the implementation of GUI and
in order to do this, additional classes (AbstractControllerImpl, ConsoleControllerImpl)
were added. The view class was also changed where it is now
HistogramViewImpl and ImageViewImpl and in both instances, the premise is to create the
viewable object for the program whether it be the operation buttons or the
histogram.

The citation for the image is:
